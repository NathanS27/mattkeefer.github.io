		<p>Hello, my name is Matt and I am a senior in highschool, located near the Boston area. Ch. 1 Men have grand dreams- some
			achieve them, some do not Ship = dreams─ some come to shore, some sail away forever (horizon motif) Language = more dreamlike
			Time + Watcher are being personified (mocking, man) Women go after attainable + realistic goals Language is blunt, dreams
			= truth Setting: Florida, 1937 Janie was in the Everglades with Tea Cake Frame narrative Porch sitters are judging/teasing
			Janie’s appearance, criticizing her life choices Janie is recently widowed, had married a rich man who died (buried the
			dead) Hair down, overalls → challenging conventions of society, independence Porch sitters are jealous of Janie, she is
			very attractive Hope Janie falls down back to their level Pheoby = Janie’s friend, somewhat defends Janie, but is not
			exactly overzealous Sam = Pheoby’s husband Janie has been gone for a year and a half She’s had a great time doing whatever
			she was doing If her “friends” asked her, she would tell them all about it Pheoby cares about Janie and is interested
			in her stories, but she doesn’t want Janie to think that she is just prying and being superficial Janie = full of the
			oldest human longing → self-revelation Self-revelation = knowing who you are, self-discovery Tea Cake is gone → that’s
			why Janie’s back from Everglades Janie will tell Pheoby about her life Ch. 2 Janie saw her life like a tree in leaf with
			all sorts of things (tree motif) She didn’t truly realize she was black until she looked at a picture of herself with
			the other children The Washburn children and her didn’t yet see racism or prejudice in society (could be hyperbole) Janie
			is called Alphabet because she had been given so many different names She doesn’t know her parents, raised by her grandmother
			Janie talks about when her childhood ends, but her life begins Janie observes bees pollinating flowers Marriage = give
			and take, mutually beneficial Masturbates under a tree, kisses Johnny Taylor Nanny wants Janie to marry and find a good,
			upper-class husband Wants her to find a happy and stable relationship, unlike her mother Nanny grew up a slave, wants
			Janie to pursue her dreams Nanny was raped by plantation owner, owner’s wife wanted to beat Nanny and sell baby Nanny
			runs away, learns that the slaves are freed</p>

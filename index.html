		<p>Their Eyes Were Watching God Ch. 1 Men have grand dreams- some
			achieve them, some do not Ship = dreams─ some come to shore, some sail away forever (horizon motif) Language = more dreamlike
			Time + Watcher are being personified (mocking, man) Women go after attainable + realistic goals Language is blunt, dreams
			= truth Setting: Florida, 1937 Janie was in the Everglades with Tea Cake Frame narrative Porch sitters are judging/teasing
			Janie’s appearance, criticizing her life choices Janie is recently widowed, had married a rich man who died (buried the
			dead) Hair down, overalls → challenging conventions of society, independence Porch sitters are jealous of Janie, she is
			very attractive Hope Janie falls down back to their level Pheoby = Janie’s friend, somewhat defends Janie, but is not
			exactly overzealous Sam = Pheoby’s husband Janie has been gone for a year and a half She’s had a great time doing whatever
			she was doing If her “friends” asked her, she would tell them all about it Pheoby cares about Janie and is interested
			in her stories, but she doesn’t want Janie to think that she is just prying and being superficial Janie = full of the
			oldest human longing → self-revelation Self-revelation = knowing who you are, self-discovery Tea Cake is gone → that’s
			why Janie’s back from Everglades Janie will tell Pheoby about her life Ch. 2 Janie saw her life like a tree in leaf with
			all sorts of things (tree motif) She didn’t truly realize she was black until she looked at a picture of herself with
			the other children The Washburn children and her didn’t yet see racism or prejudice in society (could be hyperbole) Janie
			is called Alphabet because she had been given so many different names She doesn’t know her parents, raised by her grandmother
			Janie talks about when her childhood ends, but her life begins Janie observes bees pollinating flowers Marriage = give
			and take, mutually beneficial Masturbates under a tree, kisses Johnny Taylor Nanny wants Janie to marry and find a good,
			upper-class husband Wants her to find a happy and stable relationship, unlike her mother Nanny grew up a slave, wants
			Janie to pursue her dreams Nanny was raped by plantation owner, owner’s wife wanted to beat Nanny and sell baby Nanny
			runs away, learns that the slaves are freed Ch. 3 Both Nanny and Janie’s mother were raped Janie marries Logan Killicks,
			doesn’t appreciate him Is not attracted to him, desecrates the idea of the pear tree Nanny says that black women are the
			mule of the world Wants Janie to prioritize security and safety rather than love Ch. 4 Logan wants Janie to help out with
			work around the house Janie is not having it Logan is going to Lake City to buy another mule for Janie for potato harvesting
			Joe Starks arrives and talk with Janie → connection Joe wants Janie to run off with him so they can marry Janie goes with
			Joe and they get married “From now until death she was going to have flower dust and springtime sprinkled over everything.
			A bee for her bloom” (32). Ch. 5 Joe and Janie arrive in West Maitland/Eatonville, Joe wants to set up a committee to
			help direct the town Joe buys 200 acres of land with cash for the town → becoming a leader Man talking to Hicks, “Us colored
			folks is too envious of one ‘nother. Dat’s how come us don’t git no further than us do. Us talks about de white man keepin’
			us down! Shucks! He don’t have tuh. Us keeps our own selves down” (39). Joe opens a store in Eatonville, 10 families move
			in, everything is going great Joe is elected mayor Janie is asked to give a speech on his behalf, but Joe shuts it down
			claiming Janie’s place is solely in the home She doesn’t appreciate this → strain on relationship “It must have been the
			way Joe spoke without giving her the chance to say anything one way or another that took the bloom off of things” (43).
			After street light celebration, Joe asks Janie if she enjoys being married to the mayor Janie confesses that she wishes
			he wasn’t mayor so they can enjoy time together Joe tells her that won’t happen and she feels cold/lonely Joe is a natural
			leader, however he seems to view himself as more important than others People begin to resent his success and fortune
			Realize that they blindly follow him “Speakin’ of winds, he’s de wind and we’se de grass. We bend which ever way he blows”
			(49). Townspeople defer to Joe because of his power, yet all of his power comes from the townspeople’s support Ch. 6 Matt
			Bonner’s yellow mule = skinny, overworked Townspeople are teasing Matt about the mule Joe doesn’t let Janie participate
			in “mule talk” Janie doesn’t enjoy working in the store and the post office, gives her a headache Townspeople tease and
			toy with the mule after it arrives in front of the store Janie is upset with this behavior Joe buys the mule for $5 from
			Matt to let it rest Janie compares Joe to Washington and Lincoln, as a great liberator “Abraham Lincoln, he had de whole
			United States tuh rule so he freed the Negroes. You got uh town so you freed uh mule” (58). Rumors/stories still spread
			about the mule → folklore-esque The mule dies There is going to be a funeral-type ceremony Joe won’t let Janie go, despite
			her fondness for the animal Thinks it is somehow below her, as she is the mayor’s wife Sam and Lige discuss nature vs.
			nurture using a stove example Two men are trying to flirt with Daisy, Janie is overhearing their conversation Hears Joe’s
			laugh → ruins the experience Mrs. Bogle → ship imagery “She was a wind on the ocean. She moved men, but the helm determined
			the port” (70). Joe scolds Janie in public → demeaning and hurtful “You sho loves to tell me whut to do, but Ah can’t
			tell you nothin’ Ah see!” (71). Janie thinks about her marriage Joe enjoys dominating Janie, making her submit to him
			Janie is no longer sexually attracted to him “The spirit of the marriage left the bedroom a took to living in the parlor”
			(71). Joe is being physically abusive with Janie “She wasn’t petal-open anymore with him [...] She found that out one
			day when he slapped her face in the kitchen” (71). Her image of Joe fell off her internal shelf and shattered Joe is selfish
			and uncaring when Tony’s wife asks him for food for her poor family Men are insulting Tony’s wife, Janie finally decides
			to speak her mind Joe essentially tells her to shut up and fetch a checkerboard + checkers Presentations (1-3) Dreams:
			Nanny’s dream for Janie (security > love) Wants her to get married and find a husband who can protect her → security Janie’s
			dream for herself Wants to find love in a marriage → not be lonely Freedom of choice, independence Voice: Used to highlight
			individual’s inability/ability to speak Sitters described as “tongueless, earless, eyeless” When they do speak, they are
			cruel Nanny suppresses Janie’s voice when she tries to convince her to marry Logan Slaps her (violence) → doesn’t let
			her speak Nanny consistently doesn’t allow Janie to speak → position of power Because Logan doesn’t express his true feelings
			to Janie, she ends up leaving him Logan/Janie Relationship: Logan is good to Janie, but Janie doesn’t love him Hopes that
			love will find her during their marriage Has a hope of what marriage will be like → ruined by Logan (“desecrates the pear
			tree”) Logan fits the role of working husband He had threatened Janie with an axe Logan stops spoiling Janie, she leaves
			him for Joe Starks Pear Tree: Tree is where Janie feels most comfortable As Janie matures, the tree becomes more sexual
			Tree represents death of Janie’s childhood and dawn of her life as a woman Janie views the tree as a physical embodiment
			of her struggles and experiences Ch. 7 Janie has lost all her fight/spirit Considers running away again, but says 35 is
			twice 17 → thinks she is too old now Joe ridicules Janie’s looks after she cuts a piece of chewing tobacco wrong Janie
			isn’t having it → tells Joe to stop making fun of her, claps back hard Joe feels insecure, his pride is hurt Hits Janie
			as hard as he can Ch. 8 Janie notices that Joe is looking sick and unhealthy, his body is dripping down Joe is seeing
			“root doctors” and not eating Janie’s meals → implies he doesn’t trust them Janie is deeply hurt by this → tells Pheoby
			that she would never hurt someone Janie eventually brings Joe a doctor, gets the news that Joe has kidney failure → will
			die Janie feels sorry for Jody → he still thinks two-headed doctor will save him Janie visits Joe, tells him he will die
			and tells him how selfish he has been Joe has a bit of a panic attack, still doesn’t seem to understand his mistakes Joe
			dies with her watching him Janie still feels sorry for him Ch. 9 Joe has a nice funeral, Janie finally feels free to do
			as she wishes Janie reflects on her feelings for Nanny Many suitors approach Janie, trying to marry her Janie doesn’t
			even want to think about marriage Hezekiah collects rent from townspeople for Janie → acts like her older brother, takes
			on some of Joe’s mannerisms Janie confides to Pheoby that she feels free now that Joe is dead “To my thinkin’ mourning
			oughtn’t tuh last no longer’n grief” (93). Discussion (5-7) Joe makes Janie wear a wine-colored dress to display her superiority
			Janie burns head rag → demonstrates her freedom Joe asks Janie if she enjoys being married to the mayor Janie feels “a
			feeling of coldness and fear [that] took hold of her” (46). She first starts to realize that she might not be fully happy
			with Joe Joe is sort of taking one the role of white slave owner in Eatonville Townspeople discussing whether Joe can
			actually cross the line from black to white (39) One person also states that black folks oppose others who try to enact
			change Something about change angered Hicks, but he didn’t know why because it would be a positive change for black people
			When Joe becomes mayor, he states that Janie’s place in the home (43-44) Takes “the bloom off of things” for Janie Janie
			feels cold walking home that night → Joe is described as being “unconscious of her thoughts” Janie begins to realize that
			Joe is acting similarly to Logan Whenever Joe feels insecure or weak, he takes it out on Janie Joe said he would never
			make Janie work the plow Forces Janie to work in the store Beats her like a mule During lighting ceremony in town (44-45)
			Joe states that humans can not control the sun in the sky, but they must create their own light instead Viewed as God
			by the townspeople Discussion (6-9) Jody gives mule more freedom and attention than he does Janie Black woman < mule of
			 the world Jody doesn’t let Janie go to the mule’s funeral He doesn’t want his wife to be among the common people Jody
			 craves control over others → wants Janie to submit to him Takes away her freedoms and privileges Jody puts Janie on a
			 pedestal, but he doesn’t give her the same freedoms he gives himself as mayor He is also jealous of other men who are
			 attracted to Janie → makes her wear head rag Ch. 10 Tea Cake, a.k.a. Vergible Woods, visits Janie’s store, buys cigarettes
			 They play checkers together, after Tea Cake teaches Janie how to play “He set it up and began to show her and she found
			 herself glowing inside . Somebody wanted her to play. Somebody thought it natural for her to play” (96). Stark contrast
			 to Joe who never let Janie learn anything Tea Cake helps Janie close up shop after they flirt for a while He walks her
			 back to her home, Janie sits outside all night thinking Feels like she’s known Tea Cake her whole life Ch. 11 Tea Cake
			 visits again, they go fishing at night Janie feels like a child, enjoys it Hezekiah doesn’t approve of Tea Cake being
			 near Janie, despite having no reason to dislike Tea Cake Janie tells Tea Cake that she thinks she is two old for him
			 (12 years) Tea Cake denies this before leaving for the night Janie sleeps with Tea Cake Tea Cake invites Janie to a Sunday
			 picnic Declares his love for her Ch. 12 Rumors of Janie and Tea Cake have spread all over town Pheoby talks to Janie
			 about her new relationship Tries to relay her concerns to Janie, but Janie shrugs them off Janie says she will sell the
			 store, marry Tea Cake, and then move away She wants to live the love game “Ah done lived Grandma’s way, now Ah means
			 tuh live mine” (114). DIscussion 10-12 Outside perception is the problem, not age difference Janie has already married
			 two men who were significantly older than her It is only an issue because the woman in the relationship is older and
			 more renowned Purpose of frame narrative flashback → foreshadows events that are going to happen, creates expectations/suspense
			 Why does Janie switch from wearing dresses to wearing overalls? Janie is taking big risk with Tea Cake Logan provided
			 a stable, boring life Jody had some money and clear goals to drive him Tea Cake has nothing and might be trying to steal
			 her money Tea Cake is different from Jody Teaches her to play checkers Wants her to speak her mind → “Have de nerve tuh
			 say whut you mean” (109). Treats her as an equal Janie didn’t wear black and white for Jody, she wore it to appease society
			 Now with Tea Cake, Janie doesn’t care about societal perception → wears blue Pheoby acts as middle ground → voice of
			 reason Wants to support Janie, but also doesn’t want her to be rash and impulsive, just to get hurt again Townspeople
			 mention an “undertaker up at Sanford” who just lost his wife → wants Janie to find the best match in terms of status
			 Color blue usually represents sadness, instead Janie wears blue to represent her new relationship with Tea Cake Could
			 represent Janie’s newfound peace, tranquility, and calmness Ch. 13 Janie leaves town to join Tea Cake in Jacksonville
			 They get married and move in together One day, Janie sends Tea Cake to find some fresh fish, but when she wakes up, her
			 $200 is gone along with Tea Cake Makes her reminisce about the story of Annie Tyler and Who Flung Ms. Tyler had run off
			 with him, he stole her money and dipped Janie doesn’t want to go back to Eatonville and be pitied She has $10 on her
			 and $1200 in the bank P120 → color imagery Tea Cake returns, tells Janie his story He had gone into town with the money,
			 spent it on giving people free meals He got into a fight with someone who was being ungrateful Made two bickering men
			 kiss each other with the help of peer pressure He then bought a guitar because he missed playing music Janie tells Tea
			 Cake that she wants to go with him the next time he does something exciting like that He agrees, says he was scared to
			 show her his commonness Tea Cake plans to win the money back by gambling once the railroad workers get their payday He
			 made $322 gambling, but he got cut twice after one of the workers got salty Tea Cake wants Janie to take back the money
			 he “borrowed” Wants to support her with his own money Hurston mentions Annie Tyler to bring the reader’s attention to
			 what Janie is risking by going off with Tea Cake Ch. 14 Janie is now in the Everglades with Tea Cake Tea Cake is going
			 to pick beans during the day and gamble at night Tea Cake suggests that they go hunting together Janie doesn’t know how
			 → Tea Cake insists that she learn how to shoot He truly wants to help Janie improve herself Janie becomes a great shot
			 (better than Tea Cake) Laborers and poor from all over the region come flocking to work People come to their house often
			 because Tea Cake will play guitar for everybody Janie stays home, cooking food and hunting animals like rabbits Tea Cake
			 tells Janie that he misses her when he’s out working, so Janie starts picking beans with him and everyone else too Janie
			 is loving life and her newfound social equality She can tell stories and join conversations now People are gambling outside
			 their house Man doesn’t take Tea Cake’s advice and ends up losing Ch. 15 Janie is becoming jealous A girl named Nunkie
			 is flirting with Tea Cake Janie begins to feel her seed of fear grow into a tree One day, she starts hitting Tea Cake
			 because of her suspicions Tea Cake doesn’t hit back, tries to pacify her The two have sex, work out their issue “You’se
			 something tuh make uh man forgit tuh git old and forgit tuh die” (138). Men use violence to exert their dominance and
			 control others Janie uses violence to express what she is feeling → not meant to overpower This violence usually leads
			 to honesty between Janie and Tea Cake Janie might be using violence to try to stop the interactions between Tea Cake
			 and Nunkie → similarly to how Jody hit her because another man touched her hair Relationship between power and violence
			 The more powerful someone is in a relationship, the more violent they tend to be After Janie hit Tea Cake and they go
			 to sleep, “Janie asked like a woman” (138). Shows how violence is typically associated with men Everglades Setting: nature!
			 Ch. 16 Janie and Tea Cake decide to stay in the Everglades after the harvesting season ended Janie befriends Mrs. Turner
			 Mrs. Turner can’t stand (darker) black men, doesn’t understand why Janie married Tea Cake “If it wuzn’t for so many black
			 folks it wouldn’t be no race problem” (141). Tea Cake wants Janie to stop talking to Mrs. Turner He talks to her husband
			 → realizes he won’t be able to do anything Janie tries insulting Mrs. Turner → she is forgiven because of her paler skin
			 color God metaphor (page 145) ٭ Ch. 17 It is harvesting season once more People flirt with both Janie and Tea Cake, jealousy
			 starts to arise Tea Cake starts hitting Janie Not extremely violent → wants to show others that he is in control of Janie
			 All the drunk men go to Mrs. Turner’s house on Saturday night → fight begins Tea Cake tries to break the fight up → actually
			 makes it worse Ch. 18 Janie notices large groups of Seminole Indians leaving because they suspect a hurricane is coming
			 Her and Tea Cake both shake off the warnings “Indians don’t know much uh nothin’, tuh tell de truth. Else dey’d own dis
			 country still. De white folks ain’t gone nowhere. Dey oughta know if it’s dangerous” (156). Hurricane arrives and everyone
			 huddles inside Tea Cake asks Janie if she would be mad at him if she dies in the storm She says no, “If you kin see de
			 light at daybreak, you don’t keer if you die at dusk. It’s so many people never seen de light at all. Ah wuz fumblin’
			 round and God opened de door” (159). “They sat in company with the others in other shanties, their eyes straining against
			 crude walls and their souls asking if He meant to measure their puny might against His. They seemed to be staring at
			 the dark, but their eyes were watching God” (160). Tea Cake and Janie run, trying to make it to higher ground They make
			 it to Palm Beach after Tea Cake is bitten by a dog Ch. 19 Tea Cake looks for a job/something to do with his time, Janie
			 wants him to rest Two soldiers make Tea Cake help bury the dead White people get coffins, black people are dumped in
			 large holes Tea Cake runs away from the soldiers and goes back to Janie The two head back to the Glades Tea Cake gets
			 sick so Janie gets the doctor He got rabies from the dog a month back Doctor thinks the only way he can survive is if
			 he gets locked up in the county hospital for a few weeks Janie wonders if God knows what is happening with Tea Cake right
			 now She asks Him for a sign (star in the morning, etc.) Tea Cake begins to become delirious due to his rabies He tries
			 to shoot Janie → Janie is forced to kill him Before Tea Cake dies, he bites Janie’s forearm Janie is arrested and tried
			 in court for murder She is found not guilty and is free to go Janie overhears men talking about how black women can kill
			 as many black people as they please “Well, you know whut dey say ‘uh white man and uh n***er woman is de freest thing
			 on earth.’ Dey do as dey please” (189). Janie buries Tea Cake in a nice cemetery in Palm Beach She buries him with roses
			 and a new guitar Janie wears overalls to the funeral service Too filled with grief to dress like grief Ch. 20 Janie finishes
			 telling Pheoby her story “Love is lak de sea. It’s uh movin’ thing, but still and all, it takes its shape from de shore
			 it meets, and it’s different with every shore” (191). “Here was peace. She pulled in her horizon like a great fish-net.
			 Pulled it from around the waist of the world and draped it over her shoulder. So much of life in its meshes! She called
			 in her soul to come and see” (193). Final Discussion (Day 1): Janie refers to Tea Cake as the son of the evening sun
			 She pulls her horizon in at the end of the novel → she had hopes and dreams that she was able to accomplish Whites and
			 negros separated even when dead: whites in thingy, black together in a dump White women comfort Janie after the trial,
			 while the black people in attendance are upset she wasn’t convicted White women favor Janie because she has lighter skin,
			 Tea Cake’s admirers/friends liked Tea Cake because he was more like them Tea Cake hits Janie around a little bit in the
			 Everglades Tries to exert his dominance/show he was in control Other men praise Tea Cake for his wife → she cries instead
			 of yells Glorifying violence Even Tea Cake isn’t immune to the household customs during the time period Men and women
			 are jealous of Tea Cake + Janie Men want a wife like Janie Women want a husband who cares about them/pampers them Janie’s
			 reactions to the way she is treated change throughout the novel Jody beats Janie → she resents him for it Tea Cake slaps
			 Janie around → she still loves him, has no regrets Fight at Mrs. Turner’s house was coordinated to make her leave Gender
			 roles in Mrs. Turner’s relationship are switched Her husband doesn’t help during the fight Janie still considers her
			 home to be the house she shared with Jody It is where she first gained her independence Religion: Mrs. Turner worships
			 the Caucasian characteristics that Janie has “All gods dispense suffering without reason. Otherwise they would not be
			 worshipped” (145). “fear is the most divine emotion” (145). Their Eyes Were Watching God People in the novel are waiting
			 on God to come and help them Janie begs God to save Tea Cake She eventually realizes that you have to find God, rather
			 than wait for him to come Tea Cake is described as heavenly Once he gets close to death, readers begin to view him as
			 an imperfect human → prone to violence/irrational decisions Final Discussion (Day 2): People with wealth/influence try
			 to assume the role of God, however they are still human Jody with his street light → viewed as a deity by townspeople,
			 in reality he has many flaws Tea Cake does the opposite → questions why certain people (whites) have power Tea Cake takes
			 on the role of Jesus/God in the novel He shows Janie how she should live her life He sacrifices himself to save Janie
			 Dog portrayed with evil/hellish imagery Egyptian god Anubis (death) has a dog head Egyptian goddess Hathor (love) resembles
			 a cow During funeral, Tea Cake rides like a pharoah to his tomb Janie keeps only the seeds that Tea Cake had bought Different
			 than her idea of a pear tree → Janie grew during her time with Tea Cake Things fleeing from hurricane are more in tune
			 with nature Native Americans, animals → in touch with nature/are nature Many people stay to pick beans → pursue material
			 wealth Janie killing Tea Cake is an act of mercy/self-preservation </p>
